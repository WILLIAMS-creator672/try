            <p class="text-center text-white">On 23rd September, 1987, the Military Government of General Ibrahim
                Badamosi Babangida through a
                Nation - Wide Broadcast
                created Akwa Ibom State out of the Old Cross River State. By that pronouncements ,all Machinery of
                Government and
                Organizations were transferred to the new State. The Boys' Brihad Nigeria was not left out.</p>






            <!-- <p class="text-white text-center ">However, from which angle one may look at it , History means record of past events in the development of
                a place ,people
                or organization. It may be written or spoken .
                Therefore ,writing the History of an Organization such as the BB in an heterogeneous State such as ours
                is indeed a
                daunting task.
                While we shall not delve into the trends of movement of the Organization from when it was first
                introduced to Nigeria in
                1908 ( officially ) to when the South Eastern State Council was constituted in 1970 ( soon after the end
                of the Nigerian
                Civil War ), to the creation of the Cross River State Council in 1976 following the carving out of Cross
                River and
                River's States out of the then South Eastern State .
                This paper intends to abridged the History of the Boys' Brigade in Akwa Ibom State .
